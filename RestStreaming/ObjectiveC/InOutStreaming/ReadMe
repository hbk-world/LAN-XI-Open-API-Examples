InOutStreaming

This sample shows a basic use of both input and output on a B&K LAN-XI 3160 module.
The module is configured for simultaneous input and output streaming using REST commands, and socket connections are made to transfer samples to/from the module. Input channels 1 and 2 are looped (through the PC) to the output channels ("echo").

The purpose of the sample is to illustrate what is needed to make bidirectional streaming work, and thus there has not been put much emphasis on error handling etc.

To run this example, change the values of the constants (LANXI_IP - ...) to match the desired setup:
LANXI_IP: IP Address of the 3160 module to stream to/from.
RUN_TIME: Number of seconds the input/output streaming should run.
SAMPLES_TO_PRIME: Number of samples to prime in the generator buffers of the module before output is started. Higher value may avoid buffer underruns but introduce a greater latency. 3*6000 samples should work.

The InputChannelSetup.json file may be altered to change input channel setup.
The OutputChannelStartStreaming.json file may be altered to change which channels to start. OutputChannelSetupStreaming.json may be changed to configure the generators - frequencies etc.
