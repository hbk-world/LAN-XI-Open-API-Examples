MultiModuleInputStreaming

This sample shows basic use of input streaming with multiple PTP-synchronized B&K LAN-XI modules. For use out-of-the-box, each module must have at least 4 input channels and be capable of 51.2 kHz bandwidth - e.g. 3160 (4 in, 2 out) or 3050 (6 in).
The modules are configured for streaming using REST commands, and a socket connection is made to receive the samples measured. The samples from all modules are assembled into 24-bit integers and stored in a simple file where they may be treated further.

The purpose of the sample is to illustrate what is needed to make PTP synchronization work with input streaming, and thus there has not been put much emphasis on error handling etc. The example may also only store a small number of samples, due to the way buffering and file writing was constructed.

To run this example, change the values of the constants (MASTER_IP - SLAVE_IP - OUTPUT_FILE - SAMPELS_TO_RECEIVE) to match the desired setup:
MASTER_IP: IP address or hostname of the first LAN-XI module, which will become the PTP master.
SLAVE_IP: IP address or hostname of the second LAN-XI module, which will become the PTP slave.
OUTPUT_FILE: Path to the file where the samples received should be stored. Samples are output in plain text with one value for each channel (tab-separated) per line. The first four columns contain values from the master module, slave modules are represented in the following columns.
SAMPLES_TO_RECEIVE: Sets the number of samples to garther from each channel - and store in the output file.

Furthermore, the OpenParameters.json, SyncParametersMaster.json, SyncParametersSlave.json and InputChannelSetup.json files may be altered to change the configuration of the channels.
