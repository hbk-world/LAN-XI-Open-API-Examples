Simple streaming examples using the REST protocol and sockets

These small examples should give an idea of how the REST protocol may be used to control the LAN-XI modules (type 3160). The focus is on displaying the REST commands and their sequences in certain scenarios. The examples do thus not have much in terms of fault tolerance built in.


Requirements

The examples have been developed using XCode 5.0 on OS X ver. 10.8.5. A LAN-XI type 3160 module is needed.


Changes

2013-10-11
Output timing has been optimized and reflects the changes made in firmware ver. 2.3.0.8.
OutputGenerator example now sends a configuration change while the output is on. This demonstrates the generator's ability to change configuration while output is on.
Output streaming samples make sure the generator buffers are primed before the start command is issued.

2013-10-14
Input sequence changed slightly. Tested with firmware ver. 2.3.0.9.
Minor updates to priming methods for output streaming, and comments etc.
ReadMe updates.
