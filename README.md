# LAN-XI-Open-API-Examples
LAN-XI modules are made by Brüel & Kjær in Denmark.
These modules are mainly used to measure acoustic and vibration signals from microphones and accelerometers, however some support CAN and others have bridge inputs.

The modules have an ethernet connection that supports several protocols. One of these protocols is HTTP based and is called "Open API".
The code in this repository shows how to use "Open API" in different programming languages.

The code in LAN-XI-Open-API-Examples/RestStreaming/CS/ has been tested in 2019.
The code in other directories has not been tested with the latest firmware.

You will need an "Open API" license stored inside the LAN-XI module, before you can use the examples.
