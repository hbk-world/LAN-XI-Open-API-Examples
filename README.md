# LAN-XI-Open-API-Examples
LAN-XI modules are made by Brüel & Kjær in Denmark
The modules are mainly used to measure acoustic and vibration signals from microphones and accelerometers

The Modules has an ethernet connection using several protocols, one of the protocols is HTTP based
and is called "Open API".
The code in this repository shows how to use "Open API" in different programming languages.

The code in LAN-XI-Open-API-Examples/RestStreaming/CS/ has been tested in 2019.
The code in other directories has not been tested with the latest firmware.

You will need a "Open API" licens stored inside the LAN-XI module, before you can use the examples.
