IdaArpChangeIp

This sample finds a LAN-XI module with a specific serial no on the network and changes the IP configuration of it. Any module connected to the same network - even in different subnets - should be possible to handle.
The module is discovered by using IdaArp, the same method as in the IdaArpGetInfo example.

The purpose of the sample is to illustrate what is needed to change the IP configuration of a (possibly physically unreachable) LAN-XI module through the IdaArp protocol, and thus there has not been put much emphasis on error handling etc. As a consequence, if the desired module is not found, the program will stall.

To run this example, change the value of the SN constant to match the serial no of the LAN-XI module to get information about. Furthermore, set the desired IP configuration in the new_ip, new_gw and new_subnet arrays. The format for those is { a, b, c, d } where a-d constuct the IP addresses (a.b.c.d).
